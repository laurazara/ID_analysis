# IgIDivA

## Overview

`IgIDivA` (Immunoglobulin Intraclonal Diversification Analysis) is a purpose-built tool for the analysis of the intraclonal diversification process using high-throughput sequencing data. It is written in [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Every step of the analysis can be performed interactively, thus not requiring any programming skills. It takes as input the output files "clonotypes_computation" and "grouped_alignment_nt" from the `tripr` package.
Functions for an `R` command-line use are also available.



## Installation
The `IgIDivA` scripts can be freely downloaded [here](https://github.com/laurazara/IgIDivA).
